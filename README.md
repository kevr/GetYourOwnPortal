GetYourOwnPortal
----------------

A mod that provides player ownership of portals.

This allows players to use any name of portal they wish without conflicting
with others in a multiplayer context.

With GetYourOwnPortal, no longer will empty or generic portal names plague players on multiplayer servers!

### Ownership

- When placing a portal with your hammer, you will obtain ownership of the newly built portal
- To disown a portal, use the `LAlt+E` key combination while hovering over it
- Once a portal is disowned, it cannot be given ownership again; it must be broken down and remade by the intentional owner

### Renaming

Any player may rename a portal, but it will retain its ownership. This remains an option
to allow players to assist another with portal renaming.

### Destroying

If a portal has an owner, only that owner and server admins will be able to destroy the portal with their hammer.

### Connecting With Other Players

To connect a portal with another player, both players must *disown* the connecting portals.

Example of connecting a portal between two players:
1. *Player A* creates a portal and names it *AtoB*
2. *Player A* disowns the *AtoB* portal
3. *Player B* creates a portal and names it *AtoB*
4. *Player B* disowns the *AtoB* portal
5. The two disowned *AtoB* portals connect
